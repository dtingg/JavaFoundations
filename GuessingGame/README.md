# Assignment 1: Guessing Game

You will write a program that will be a simple guessing game. The program will come up with a random integer between 0 and 100 inclusively. The user is allowed to continuously make guesses until correct. Each incorrect guess, the program will tell the user whether the random number is higher or lower.

Be sure to javadoc your code where applicable and provide meaningful comments.

Assumptions:  
The user will only enter integer values.  
The random integer is within the stated range.

A sample output is given below.

Guess a number between 0 and 100  
Enter a number: 50  
It's lower.  
Enter a number: 25  
It's lower.  
Enter a number: 12  
It's lower.  
Enter a number: 6  
You got it right in 4 guesses  

Extra Challenge (optional):
Add additional code to restart the game going based on a users response.
