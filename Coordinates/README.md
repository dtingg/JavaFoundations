# Assignment 2: Coordinates

You will write a program that will provide the X and Y coordinates based off of inputs entered into the console. The program will calculate the coordinate based on the directional commands provided: u-up, d-down, l-left, and r-right. lowercase and uppercase letters will be accepted. Numbers will also be accepted. Any other letters or characters should be ignored. Up and Down commands will change the y-values and Left and Right commands will change the x-values. A number preceding a letter will represent the number of commands for that direction.

Be sure to javadoc your code where applicable and provide meaningful comments.

A sample output is given below.
